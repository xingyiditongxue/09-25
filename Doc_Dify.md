Hello, I have the whole source codes of the open-source project Dify. Mainly the the project has 7 parts:
I. src directory, or, in other words, the root level of the src directory. Here we could get the i18n ReadMe.mds, the i10N Contributing files, almost all the configuration files. So basically at the root level of src directory, we could have an overview of the project, what is its objective, how it was built, what could it serve as.
II. api directory. Here we mainly design the API supporting of the application/the project Dify.
III. dev directory. It seems to be the test files and running scripts for dev environment, which are isolated from real production environment.
IV. docker directory, which seems the configurations and components that support the application/project Dify running within docker environment.
V. sdks directory, which includes 3 sub-folders: nodejs-client, php-client and python-client. Which I do not really understand the purpose of these folders, seems like they handle the visit to the application in different languages?
VI. web directory, where normally we could find all the web-ui design and front-end components codes. Does it have any background logic though? I am curious about that.
VII. .devcontainer directory. This last one is a hidden directory, and it concerns normally the running of dev environment within a docker.
Now I have very serious and urgent request: I would like to generate the DocUser.md file for this project based on its code sources.
This DocUser.md better has, firstly all the possible inter-components interfactions and User Interface interactions;
secondly all the technical choices, that an experienced user should know about the application - what are the parameters that they could set for their AI models, what are the parameters that they could set for their work flow, their knowledge base, their agents;
And thirdly, all design choices that you think valuable of the application/project Dify. For example, the UI component marketplace, where we save the choices to the users to pick their wanted models and tools, instead of offering all at sudden; or for example the supporting of docker mode, which enables an easier and more compatible way to run the application.
Could you help me completing this DocUser.md from scratch. I will offer you for each turn, all the contents of one directory, so that you could focus on that directory and resume it and extract all information that you think valuable to be put into the DocUser.md. You could output all the valuable points as many as you want, I will to the editing task.
After have taken a deep breath, are you ready to help me?
I suggest that we begin with the root level of src directory, cause it may offer an overview of the project. But I will respect your suggestion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you go. Please analyze the joined file (all the contents of the root level of `src` directory), help me completing my `DocUser.md`.

Remember: all the user interactions, all the inter-component interactions, all the settings and parameters that user could adjust and configure within the application, and finally, all the design and supported services which are valuable for this part of the project, do not hesitate to output as many as possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent. Based on the files you've provided from the root of the `src` directory, I have analyzed the contents and extracted the following key points. These are structured to align with your request for the `DocUser.md` file, covering interactions, technical choices, and valuable design decisions.

Here is the summary of valuable information from the root level of the `src` directory:

### **Part 1: Project Overview & Core Concepts**

*   **Project Goal**: Dify is an open-source LLM (Large Language Model) application development platform. Its primary objective is to provide an intuitive interface that combines AI workflows, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, agent capabilities, and model management to enable rapid development from prototype to production.
*   **Core Components**: The project is architecturally divided into a backend API, a frontend web interface, and Docker configurations for deployment.
    *   **Backend API (`/api`)**: A Python application built with the Flask framework.
    *   **Frontend Web (`/web`)**: A modern web application built using Next.js 15, TypeScript, and React 19.
    *   **Docker Deployment (`/docker`)**: Contains all necessary configurations for containerized deployment.
*   **Target Audience**: The platform is designed for both developers and less technical users, aiming to simplify the creation and management of AI-native applications.

### **Part 2: User and Component Interactions**

*   **Primary User Interaction Flow (Self-Hosting)**:
    1.  The user starts by ensuring their system meets the minimum requirements (CPU >= 2 Cores, RAM >= 4 GiB).
    2.  The user clones the repository and navigates to the `docker` directory.
    3.  They copy the example environment file (`.env.example`) to a new `.env` file to prepare for custom configuration.
    4.  The application is launched using a single command: `docker compose up -d`.
    5.  After the containers are running, the user accesses the web interface at `http://localhost/install` to perform the initial setup and configuration of the Dify platform.
*   **Inter-Component Interaction (During Setup)**:
    *   The `Makefile` provides a `dev-setup` command that orchestrates the setup of all major components.
    *   It first starts the necessary middleware (databases, message brokers) using `docker-compose.middleware.yaml`.
    *   It then prepares the web frontend by installing dependencies with `pnpm` and building the project.
    *   Finally, it sets up the API backend by installing Python dependencies with `uv` and running database migrations with `flask db upgrade`. This demonstrates a clear, scripted interaction between the `docker`, `web`, and `api` components.
*   **Community and Support Interaction**: The project actively encourages user interaction through multiple channels listed in the README files:
    *   **GitHub Discussions**: For feedback and questions.
    *   **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests.
    *   **Discord Server**: For community chat and sharing applications.
    *   **X (Twitter)**: For community engagement.

### **Part 3: Technical Choices & Configuration Parameters**

*   **Deployment Strategy**:
    *   **Docker as Primary Choice**: The primary and recommended method for deployment is using Docker and Docker Compose. This is a deliberate design choice to ensure a consistent, easy-to-manage, and cross-platform installation experience for users.
    *   **Advanced Deployment Options**: For more experienced users and production environments, the project supports and links to community-provided deployment scripts for various platforms, including:
        *   Kubernetes (via Helm Charts and YAML files).
        *   Terraform for cloud platforms like Azure and Google Cloud.
        *   AWS CDK for deployment on AWS (both EKS and ECS).
        *   Specific one-click deployment options for Alibaba Cloud.
*   **Key User-Configurable Parameters**:
    *   Users can customize their deployment by editing the `.env` file within the `docker` directory. The `README.md` explicitly points users to the `.env.example` file as a template for all available environment variables. This is the central place for users to configure database connections, service ports, and other operational parameters.
*   **Backend Technology Stack**:
    *   The backend is a Python Flask application.
    *   Asynchronous tasks are managed using **Celery** with **Redis** as the message broker, a robust choice for handling long-running AI tasks in the background.
*   **Internationalization (i18n)**:
    *   The frontend is designed to support multiple languages. The presence of numerous translated `README` and `CONTRIBUTING` files, along with technical notes in `CLAUDE.md`, confirms that all user-facing text must use i18n keys, with English as the source language. This is a significant feature for a global user base.

### **Part 4: Valuable Design Choices & Features**

*   **Extensibility through Plugins**: The contribution guidelines mention separate repositories for official and community-contributed plugins (`dify-official-plugins` and `dify-plugins`). This indicates a modular and extensible architecture, allowing users and the community to add new models, tools, and functionalities without altering the core codebase.
*   **Comprehensive Usage Tiers**: Dify is offered in several editions, catering to different user needs:
    *   **Dify Cloud**: A fully managed, zero-setup cloud service with a free tier that includes GPT-4 calls. This lowers the barrier to entry for new users.
    *   **Community Edition**: The self-hostable open-source version, giving users full control over their data and infrastructure.
    *   **Enterprise Edition**: Offers additional features for organizational needs, indicating a clear path for professional and commercial use.
*   **Open-Source Licensing with Clear Boundaries**: The project uses a modified Apache 2.0 license. This choice encourages adoption and contribution while protecting the project's commercial interests. Key restrictions that an experienced user should know are:
    *   A commercial license is required to operate a multi-tenant (multi-workspace) service.
    *   The Dify logo and copyright information must not be removed from the frontend interface.
*   **AI-Assisted Development**: The existence of a `CLAUDE.md` file is a unique and forward-thinking design choice. It provides explicit instructions for an AI code assistant on how to interact with the codebase, which can significantly speed up development and assist contributors.
*   **Multi-language Support**: The project provides `README` and `CONTRIBUTING` files in over a dozen languages, demonstrating a strong commitment to building a global and inclusive community from the very beginning.

This analysis of the root directory provides a strong foundation for the `DocUser.md`. We have a clear picture of what Dify is, how to install and configure it, its core architecture, and the key design principles that guide its development.

I am now ready for the contents of the next directory. Please proceed.
